#### Background

> I'm creating Regreso, a productivity app with the goal of simplifying remembering. It is currently in a alpha stages, but I want to explain and lay out my vision for the project.

#### Regreso is an idea...

for a better memory-management solution. I've used many other tools, such as Obsidian
and Logseq, but these often fail to meet my core need of remembering things and further more, finding them later. There are of course browser extensions and plugins for these tools that solve some of the same problems Regreso aims to address, but these types of fixes often create the problem of trying to add everything to one app, and in my experience, decreasing the overall quality of the product.

#### I want Regreso to be different

I don't want to create just another notes app. It's not supposed to be a Kanban board or project manager either. It's supposed to be a simple, central place for ideas and facts. Its power isn't in the collection of these things though, it's in their recollection. Organizing, sorting, grouping, tagging, and visualizing these things should be as simple as possible.

But more than that, remembering and finding them later should be too.
